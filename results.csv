Sited on the first of three lots, totaling just shy of two acres, you will reach this home by traveling over quaint, beautiful country roads. There is ample parking here - and the only sound for a moment is the rustle of wind in the trees. From here, look up to the home, perched on an outcropping and waiting for the right buyer to bring it to its full potential. Enter through the enclosed porch and sliding doors into the large living room, with a wood-burning stove set inside a stone fireplace. The wood floors shine from the natural light that streams through the windows. Despite being in the middle of a beautiful forest, there are few trees directly around the home, making it a bright house. Past the living room, find the central hallway. To the right, a bedroom and full hall bath. To the left, an unheated space that could have many uses. Ahead, we find the eat-in kitchen with classic wood cabinets. From here, we can look out to the woods beyond through the bay window. Off of the kitchen is the primary bedroom, with a vaulted ceiling, two closets and a full, private bathroom. Step from the bedroom to the large rear deck. From here, you can see the rear yard and two other connected lots, including one that fronts on the road below. Stone walls wind their way at the edge of the property and the steps down from the deck lead to a path. Will you walk further into the beautiful woods to the other lots, or back around to the front of the home?

Yorktown is known for its high-demand schools, vibrant community, and incredibly convenient lifestyle-minutes to the Taconic, close to the NYC commute, train, shops, restaurants, and every necessity-yet this home sits in a pocket of beauty and calm that makes coming back each day feel like a reward. From the instant you pull up, there's a holy cow moment-a genuine sense that you've ""arrived."" The curb appeal is exquisite: a masterful blend of brick and luxury vinyl, framed by impeccably landscaped grounds. The driveway is smooth as butter with room for everyone, and the generous side yard creates a wonderful buffer between neighbors. But the backyard... that's where the magic happens. Exceptionally peaceful. Wrapped in trees for privacy. Just over a third of an acre that feels like nature's embrace. And the deck? Spacious, inviting, and complete with a built-in hot tub-your personal haven of relaxation. You'll want to stay out here forever. And still, the best is yet to come. Step inside to a home that is ABSOLUTELY DIVINE. The floor plan is open, glamorous, pristine-straight out of HDTV. Every inch glistens. Everywhere you look, something is sparkling new. New windows. New front door. New hardwood floors. Completely renovated kitchen and bathrooms. New interior doors, tile, and trim. This is luxury you can feel the moment you walk in. The first floor unfolds with a stunning living room that flows into a massive, show-stopping kitchen-truly one of the best you'll ever see. A huge granite island anchors the space, surrounded by endless granite countertops that wrap around you in rich, elegant style. Stunning white cabinetry offers abundant storage, and the high-end stainless-steel appliances make cooking a joy. A lovely dining area sits just off the kitchen, keeping entertaining effortless. A fabulous den/family room adds even more flexibility, complete with its own fireplace and easily usable as a first-floor bedroom if desired. A full, magnificently upgraded bathroom completes this level. Upstairs, the primary suite feels like something curated just for you, offering a gorgeous new full bath. One of the upstairs bedrooms is currently a massive walk-in dressing room-every fashion lover's dream-but can be converted back with ease. Two additional large bedrooms and a third full, exquisite bathroom complete the second floor. The home is a legal four-bedroom, ready to adapt to your needs. And it still doesn't stop. The basement presents fantastic extra space, perfect for a home gym, hobby area, or storage heaven. Major upgrades bring peace of mind and long-term value: new electric panel, new boiler, Nest thermostat, hot tub, EV charger, generator plug-in, plus a new roof, new siding, and a new driveway. Truly, you won't have to lift a finger. This is more than a beautifully renovated home. It's a beginning. A place where comfort, luxury, and convenience weave together to create the next chapter of the life you've been dreaming of.

This 3-family home has been cherished by the same family for decades, and now it's ready for its next chapter. Tucked right into the heart of historic Tarrytown where charm, character, and community meet the Hudson, this property is all about possibility. Inside, you'll find a 2-bedroom, 1-bath unit, along with two additional units, each offering 1 bedroom and 1 bath, perfect setups for rental income, multigenerational living, or a smart house-hack situation. Yes, it needs some love... but that's where the magic is. With the right vision (and a little elbow grease), this home can truly shine again. Whether you're an investor looking for your next project, a savvy buyer searching for an income-producing property, or someone dreaming of a place where you can live on one floor and let the other units work for you, this is the opportunity you've been waiting for. Multi-family homes in Tarrytown don't come up often, and when they do, they don't last. The location, the character, the potential... it's all here.

This impressive home delivers a rare combination of scale, flexibility, and location-perfect for modern living, entertaining, and multi-generational needs. The home offers six bedrooms and is filled with natural light throughout, creating a bright and airy atmosphere across its expansive layout. Thoughtfully updated with top-of-the-line fixtures, finishes, and materials, the home reflects pride of ownership and a high level of quality consistent with a well-maintained residence. Generously proportioned rooms, multiple living areas, and an intuitive flow make the home both comfortable and functional. The primary bedroom suite serves as a private retreat, featuring an en-suite bathroom and private balcony. Additional bedrooms are well sized and versatile, accommodating guest space, home offices, or creative use as desired. A substantial approximately 1,400 square foot addition dramatically enhances the home's living space. While public tax records reflect approximately 3,500 square feet, the actual usable living area is closer to 5,000 square feet, offering exceptional value rarely found in the area. Comparable homes of this size and quality in this submarket have commanded significantly higher prices when fully completed and permitted. The addition includes a large separate family room with its own private rear entrance, creating flexibility for extended living, work-from-home use, or guest accommodations (subject to municipal approvals). This area connects to an upper level featuring an additional bedroom, full bathroom, and family room. Additional highlights include finished attic space with its own private balcony, further expanding usable living area and lifestyle options. Set on a generously sized lot, the property provides valuable outdoor space while maintaining privacy and comfort. The home has been well maintained, with select improvements identified that are typical for a residence of this size and scope. A professional estimate has been obtained and can be made available, offering the next owner the opportunity to address these items and further customize the home. The asking price reflects thoughtful consideration of the current condition and the work identified, presenting a remarkable opportunity for a buyer to capture significant equity in a location where similarly sized homes have sold for considerably more. Conveniently located near the Hutchinson River Parkway, Cross County Parkway, shopping, dining, schools, and public transportation.
